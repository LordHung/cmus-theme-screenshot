cmus Theme: Screenshot
======================

When I first saw cmus screenshot on its website, I wanted to download it 
right away. Unfortunately, there's no theme like that available (at least
not one that is independent of your terminal color settings). So I made 
one myself!

**IMPORTANT: this will only work on terminals that support 256 colors**

*NOTE: as someone from the cmus-devel mailing list pointed out, the theme
on the screenshot is* zenburn*, which is available
[here](http://gitorious.org/cmus/cmus/blobs/master/data/zenburn.theme)
and should ship with cmus on upcoming releases.*

Instructions
------------

Just drop `screenshot.theme` on `~/.cmus` and run `:colorscheme screenshot`.
