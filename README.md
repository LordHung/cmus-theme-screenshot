cmus Theme: Screenshot
======================

When I first saw cmus screenshot on its website, I wanted to download it 
right away. Unfortunately, there's no theme like that available (at least
not one that is independent of your terminal color settings). So I made 
one myself!

**IMPORTANT: this will only work on terminals that support 256 colors**

Instructions
------------

Just drop `screenshot.theme` on `~/.cmus` and run `:colorscheme screenshot`.
